# Ghost

A small Electron app for setting a fixed phone location or following a road route over USB or Wi-Fi. Search for a
place, drop a pin, or enter coordinates, then explicitly apply it to your selected
phone. Windows and macOS share one interface and use the appropriate iPhone or
Android adapter.

Current version: **0.1.7**. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the onboarding,
interface, Android cleanup, Windows packaging, recovery-record, and reconnection changes.

## Download and install

Get [Ghost 0.1.7 for Mac or Windows](https://github.com/Blueturboguy07/ghost-location/releases/tag/v0.1.7).
Follow the [setup guide](SETUP.md) for Mac → iPhone, Windows → iPhone, Mac → Android, or Windows → Android, or use [Publik's guided install](https://publikhq.com/ghost/install).

The downloads include the phone runtimes. No programming tools or Ghost account are needed. These early releases are unsigned; the guide explains opening them and the limits of current device testing.

## Features


- Road routes through up to 12 stops, 45 mph movement, one-second updates, Pause and Resume.
- Direct train routes between two station-area points, timetable-derived average speed, railway overlay, Pause and Resume.
- Interactive map, manual place search, draggable pin, and latitude/longitude input.
- First-run Mac/Windows and iPhone/Android survey with a checklist tailored to all four USB configurations.
- Saved places and recent selections stored locally.
- A one-click USB → Wi-Fi handoff keeps the current location and resumes routes. Ghost offers it after a working USB session when the computer has Wi-Fi. Android 11+ also supports cable-free pairing.
- iPhone location simulation through a bundled pymobiledevice3 sidecar.
- Android location simulation through bundled ADB and Appium Settings.
- Ongoing fixed-location updates and same-phone reconnection while Ghost stays open.
- Automatic stale recovery-record cleanup when a different usable USB phone appears.
- Explicit restoration, normal-quit cleanup, and a persisted recovery journal.
- Honest disconnected/error states: lost connectivity never means “restored”.
- No account, telemetry, analytics, or cloud location history.

## Development

Use Node.js 24 LTS and npm. Python 3.12 or 3.13 is needed only to **build** the iPhone
runtime. End users of a complete packaged release do not install Python, Node.js,
Android Studio, or Appium Server.

```sh
npm ci
npm run runtime:prepare
npm run dev
```

`GHOST_BUILD_PYTHON` can point to a specific Python executable. A runtime build can
download public Python packages, Apple-device support dependencies, Google's
platform tools, and the Android helper. Driver installation and changes to phone
settings are performed through the setup flow, not by the build scripts.

For a browser-only interface preview: `npm run preview`. Hardware controls are only
available inside Electron. For a production renderer inside Electron: `npm start`.

## Device setup

On first launch, choose the computer and phone you use. Ghost saves that choice
locally and shows only the relevant setup checklist. Open **Setup** in the toolbar
or **Change** in Settings to review or switch configurations later.

**iPhone (initial target: iOS 17.4+):** connect with a USB data cable, unlock and
trust the computer, enable Developer Mode in Settings → Privacy & Security, and
restart when requested. Use Ghost's Prepare action to mount the developer support
image. Initial preparation requires internet and can take a few minutes. Windows
also needs Apple's USB services/drivers (upstream recommends Microsoft Store
iTunes). The application does not remove passcodes or change Find My settings.

**Android (8.0+):** enable Developer options and USB debugging, connect a USB data
cable, and approve the computer's RSA prompt. Ghost's explicit Prepare action
installs Appium Settings, grants location access, and selects it as the mock-location
provider. Follow any additional device-specific prompts. Some Windows phones need
the manufacturer's ADB USB driver. No root is required by this approach.

## Session behavior

Selecting a map pin only changes the preview. **Set location** starts or updates a
fixed location on the selected phone. Only one unresolved phone session is
kept at a time. When an unknown, waiting, or error recovery record belongs to a
different phone and Ghost discovers another usable USB phone, Ghost automatically
discards the old record so the newly connected phone can be prepared or have a
location set.
Active, applying, reconnecting, and stopping sessions remain protected from this
automatic cleanup.

On iPhone, the sidecar reasserts the selected coordinates on a one-second loop.
Each DVT location command is awaited before Ghost records its acknowledgement.
Fresh acknowledgements also keep the selected USB connection ready during
discovery polling, so a transient discovery miss does not gray out a healthy
session. On Android, the on-phone helper emits timestamped mock fixes every two
seconds; the desktop checks the helper's reported coordinates.

The interface distinguishes command acknowledgements from helper readbacks.
An iOS acknowledgement confirms the developer command, and an Android readback
confirms the helper's coordinates. Neither proves a fresh GPS reading in a phone
app. The Android receiver does not expose the fix timestamp to the desktop.
Verify the result in the intended phone app.

**Restore** stops the Android mock service or sends the iOS clear-location command.
The iOS clear API does not return an independent real-GPS measurement; cached
locations in other apps can take time to update. Normal quit attempts restoration
by default. If that fails, Ghost offers to keep the app open or quit with an
unresolved session saved for recovery.

If the phone disconnects during a live session, Ghost waits and automatically reconnects
the **same phone and applied target** when it becomes available again, while the
same Ghost process remains open. Selecting another pin still changes only the
preview; use **Update location** to apply that target. You can also use **Retry
location** or **Reconnect & set location** on the same phone after a connection
failure. While the previous session is active, applying, reconnecting, or stopping,
a different phone remains blocked.

If that previous session is already unresolved as unknown, waiting, or error,
connecting a different usable USB phone automatically removes the old recovery
record instead. This does not send **Restore** to the old phone. Because the old
phone is absent or cannot be verified, it may retain its last simulated location
until it is restarted or restored separately.

**Restore** cancels automatic reconnection, including while the cable is absent.
If reconnection is already in progress, Ghost waits for that bounded operation
before clearing the simulation. An unplugged phone must reconnect before Ghost
can send the clear command.

USB unplug, laptop sleep, force-quit, and a crashed helper cannot guarantee immediate
restoration. Android's upstream helper can keep supplying its last coordinates
without the cable. After Ghost restarts, continuing or clearing a saved session on
the same phone requires a manual **Retry location** or **Restore**; it is never
automatically resumed on startup. A different usable phone instead triggers the
unresolved-record cleanup described above.
An iPhone restart is a further recovery step if its developer simulation becomes
stuck.

## Road and train route playback

Choose **Route**, select a start using search, coordinates, or a map pin, and click
**Add selected pin to route**. Repeat for the destination and any intermediate
stops, in order. **Plan road route** previews the driving route. **Start route**
moves the selected phone to the first road point and begins playback.

Ghost uses the open-source [OSRM](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend)
routing service with OpenStreetMap roads. Pins snap to roads within 1 km; if no
connected driving route exists, planning fails instead of drawing a straight line.
The speed is fixed at **45 mph (20.1168 m/s)** along the full geometry, irrespective
of traffic or speed limits. Location commands run every second in the desktop
backend, including while the window is minimized. The blue dot shows the last
sent point, not an independently measured phone position. Android reuses Appium
Settings' immediate update on each new target; its idle heartbeat remains two seconds.

**Pause** holds the last point. **Resume** continues from there. Arrival holds the
exact destination; **Restore real location** stops simulation. Disconnect and sleep
pause motion. Reconnection holds the last attempted point on the same phone until
you press Resume. Slow commands or scheduling stalls pause rather than building a
backlog or jumping ahead. Timings depend on the operating system and connection latency;
the app does not guarantee that every phone app consumes each fix.

Route geometry and progress stay in memory. Restarting Ghost does not resume a
route; it keeps the existing recovery record for Retry or Restore. Restore before
editing an active route or changing phones.

### Train routes

In **Route**, choose **Train**, then add exactly two points: one near the departure
station and one near the arrival station. Click **Find direct train route**. Ghost
searches for a current direct rail itinerary with stations within 2 km of those
points, draws the returned train geometry, and shows an OpenRailwayMap overlay.

Train planning uses the community-run Transitous MOTIS API and its underlying public
transport data sources. Transitous's current U.S. source configuration includes both
[Amtrak scheduled data and Amtrak GTFS-Realtime trip updates](https://github.com/public-transport/transitous/blob/master/feeds/us.json),
so direct Amtrak trips are supported when that feed returns a current itinerary and
route geometry. Ghost displays the returned operator and service (for example,
**Amtrak · Northeast Regional**) in the route summary.

The first version supports direct train trips only. Coverage and realtime information
depend on the source agencies. The OpenRailwayMap layer shows general physical railway
infrastructure, not Amtrak-only tracks; playback follows only the itinerary geometry
returned by Transitous. The phone moves along the
returned rail geometry at a constant speed, initially calculated from the returned
train-leg duration; it does not reproduce acceleration, braking, or station dwell
timing point by point. Planning or previewing a train route never sends a location to
the phone. Starting it uses the same one-second device update, Pause, Resume,
reconnection, destination hold, and Restore behavior as a road route.

**Cary, NC (CYN)** is built in: search `CYN` or click **Add Cary, NC (CYN)** in Train
mode. Its station coordinates (35.788294, -78.782246) come from
[Amtrak's GTFS station feed](https://content.amtrak.com/content/gtfs/GTFS.zip), retrieved
2026-09-15. The shortcut works offline; finding a trip still needs Transitous and a
direct service to your selected destination.

Set **Train speed (mph)** from 1 to 500 before starting or during playback, or
return to **Use timetable average**. The custom range is a simulation setting,
not a real train capability. **Use maximum** is available for identified Amtrak
Piedmont services at 79 mph, based on [NCRR's corridor information](https://ncrr.com/faqs/).
Other services show **Maximum unavailable**: the routing feed does not supply a
verified maximum. This preset is not live tracking or a per-track speed limit.

**Jump forward** advances by the entered minutes at the selected speed, following
the planned geometry and preserving a paused route. **Skip to destination** moves
immediately to the exact endpoint. Both need an active connection to the original
phone. Jumps past the end stop at the destination and hold until **Restore real
location**. These controls also work for road routes, whose speed remains 45 mph.

## Maps, search, and privacy

Search sends your submitted text to the configured Photon provider. Viewing the map
requests tiles from OpenStreetMap. Device identifiers and saved/session coordinates
stay in the local application settings file. Planning a road route sends the chosen
stop coordinates (without device identifiers) to the public OSRM service. Planning
a train route sends the two selected coordinates to Transitous. Train mode also
requests OpenRailwayMap overlay tiles. Route playback itself makes no routing-service
requests. Search is rate-limited and cached for
the running app; there is no autocomplete, background geocoding, or offline tile
download. Pin and coordinate selection remain available if search fails.

The default Photon public demo is appropriate only for moderate use and has no
availability guarantee. Change the HTTPS Photon API endpoint in Settings for a
larger public deployment. See THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.

The OSRM demo service is for reasonable noncommercial use, capped at one request
per second, with no uptime guarantee. Ghost requests it only on **Plan road route**.
See [OSRM's demo policy](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Demo-server).
A larger public deployment needs its own routing service instead of relying on the demo.

## Build installers

```sh
npm test
npm run build
npm run runtime:prepare
npm run pack
npm run dist
```

Build on each target operating system. macOS Apple Silicon, macOS Intel and Windows
x64 use matching Python sidecars and ADB resources. Windows ARM is not a supported
release target yet. The packaging check refuses to produce an app with missing
device runtimes. Release installers are unsigned. Signing/notarization credentials are required
for a trusted macOS launch and a recognized Windows publisher.
No publishing or repository upload is performed by these commands.

For v0.1.7, a macOS arm64 build produces `Ghost-0.1.7-mac-arm64.dmg` and
`Ghost-0.1.7-mac-arm64.zip` in `release/`.

### Native CI builds

`.github/workflows/build.yml` defines separate native jobs for Windows x64
(`windows-2025`), macOS Apple Silicon (`macos-15`), and macOS Intel
(`macos-15-intel`). Each uses pinned Node.js 24.18.0 and Python 3.12.10, installs
the npm lockfile with `npm ci`, builds both phone runtimes, runs tests, and produces
unsigned installers. Action implementations are pinned to commit hashes.
The Python pin is the latest 3.12 build available for these macOS/Windows targets
in GitHub's `actions/python-versions` manifest; newer 3.12 entries there are Linux-only.

The prepack check verifies executable CPU types, the actual iOS executable and
Python bundle, Android helper version/checksum, ADB files/checksums, license notices,
and device-free launch smoke checks. Native target matching is required because
electron-builder's `${platform}` resource macro resolves to `darwin` or `win32`
from its build host. Cross-platform packaging and Windows ARM are excluded.

CI uploads installers and provenance as workflow artifacts only; it does not
publish a GitHub release, upload to a store, or use signing credentials. Passing
CI does not verify real phones. Complete the hardware test matrix before claiming
phone/OS compatibility.

## Validation

`npm test` checks USB filtering, exact-device targeting, argument handling,
adapter failures, acknowledgement handling, fixed-target refresh, same-process
reconnection, cancellation, persisted crash recovery, concurrency,
search validation, saved settings, route interpolation, one-second scheduling,
pause/resume, arrival, slow transport, and cancellation during an in-flight update. Sidecar-specific Python tests are in
`sidecar/` where applicable. See docs/hardware-test-matrix.md for on-device checks.

`npm run test:ios-stream` runs a hardware-free stress harness through the real
Node adapter, JSONL bridge loop, Python bridge, and pinned upstream location API.
It replaces only the USB/tunnel/DVT peer, then checks repeated acknowledgements,
an in-place target update, concurrent discovery, and post-Restore silence.

`npm run test:native` launches Electron with isolated settings and exercises map
search, live OSRM road planning, coordinates, saved-place create/rename/delete, setup, preferences, and a
compact window. It performs read-only USB discovery but never invokes phone
preparation, Set, or Restore. Screenshots are written to `artifacts/`. It requires
a graphical desktop; live search and map tiles need internet access.

`npm run test:renderer-session` runs a separate, bounded Electron fixture with no
device adapters and all external requests blocked. Ten real-time heartbeats span
more than eight seconds, checking that Update stays enabled, the pending pin and
selected phone persist, focus is retained, recovery restores the controls, and
only an explicit Update submits the new target. It also checks route stop selection,
plan/start/pause/resume controls, and a moving map dot with fake device state. It uses existing Electron and
Playwright dependencies, temporary settings, and a 45-second deadline; no phone
runtime or network access is needed.

To check an already packaged app, set `GHOST_SMOKE_EXECUTABLE` to its executable and
run `node scripts/smoke-electron.mjs`. The check also requires both bundled runtimes
to report available. See docs/validation.md for the recorded local build results.

Automated transport tests use controlled doubles; they are not evidence of phone
compatibility. The project must be tested on actual target phone/OS combinations
before claiming all four connections are verified.
